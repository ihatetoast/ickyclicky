# Icky Clicky

Icky Clicky is a memory built on ReactJS.

The player sees a grid made up of images of icky things and clicks on an image. If she has not already clicked on the image, the score increases by one point. After every click, the deck is shuffled. The user clicks on another image. As long as it's a new image, the score keeps increasing. Once the player clicks on an image she's already clicked on, the score is reset to 0, and the game begins again.
